# BlockTube-Upload-Range-Blocker
This script blocks all videos from being displayed on YouTube after a given upload date. In the case of this project, all uploads after 2012 are undisplayed. It can be easily modified to change the upload date range. Beware, this breaks YouTube's recommendation features and I've found YouTube's algorithm extremely reluctant to recommend videos more than a minute long.
